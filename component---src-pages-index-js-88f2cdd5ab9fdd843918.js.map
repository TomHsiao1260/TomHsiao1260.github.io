In this period, he cooperated with TSMC to research semiconductor related fields, and published his works in AIP Advances as the first author. In addition, his father is an art lover with artistic background who taught him to draw as he was young. Thus, Yao also tries to explore more possibilities of human and machine cooperation in art. \n        </p>\n        <p>In addition, the sketch 《Most beautiful equation in math》 has been invited and published in 《Science Monthly》 in Taiwan. In the future, he hopes to use what he has learned to merge the spirit of science and technology into art, our society, and daily life.\n        </p>\n        <p>Email: tomtogo1260@gmail.com</p>\n      </div>\n      <div className={styles.image}>\n        <Img fluid={data.file.childImageSharp.fluid} />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n        description\n        icon\n      }\n    }\n    file(relativePath: {eq: \"about.jpg\"}) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 500) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`"],"sourceRoot":""}
